# Sources

You can think of a source kind of like a [ConcourseCI Resource](https://concourse-ci.org/resources.html), but it only implements `check` and `get` operations. Another analogy a combination of Kargo [Warehouses](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/core-concepts/#warehouses) & [Freight](https://docs.kargo.io/user-guide/core-concepts/#freight).
