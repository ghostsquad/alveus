# Alveus

Dynamically creates GitHub workflows to allow for progressive delivery of Kubernetes resources across environments.

This is designed as a replacement for [Kargo](https://docs.kargo.io/) using Github Actions as the execution engine.

This initial version of Alveus uses GitHub actions as it's "execution platform".
